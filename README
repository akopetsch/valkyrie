Valkyrie, Copyright(c) 2011-2013 Stefano Teso
Released under the GPL v3 License.


DISCLAIMER
==========

Valkyrie is an experimental SEGA Hikaru emulator for GNU/Linux. It was
written entirely by reverse engineering the little Hikaru software available.
As of now, this Hikaru emulator is unstable, incomplete, primitive, slow,
crude, and sometimes hacky.

DON NOT EXPECT GAMES TO RUN AT ALL.

Until the time comes, Valkyrie should be considered a ``technological
preview'', and is really targeted towards developers rather than users.
If you are not interested in developing valkyrie, please consider waiting
until it becomes stable and usable enough.

Valkyrie is licensed under the GPL v3 License, see the LICENSE file.


CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
======================================

At the present moment, valkyrie is able to run all known Hikaru BOOTROMs
(versionsi 0.84, 0.92, 0.96) and the existing complete ROM dumps typically
up to attract mode. While still largely incomplete, 3D emulation is there.
Please see the CONTRIBUTING file for hints as to where the biggest emulation
issues are.

Concerning future developments, I can only say that I personally have very
little time to dedicate to Valkyrie. That said, you are free to clone this
repository and do your own work on your branch, provided that you respect the
license. If you do work on valkyrie, please contact me so we can possibly
coordinate our efforts.

You are free to make use the information contained in this source for your
own project. If you make use of this work in any way, you may want to give
credit where it is due. You are also encouraged to keep your emulator open
source, so that other developers (and their users) can benefit from it. You
are also encouraged to contribute back the technical findings you may
stumble into.


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============

Thanks to the MAME developers for the hardware description and the initial
memory map annotated in their skeleton Hikaru driver (as of 2011.) Also
thanks to the MAME, nullDC, and lxdream developers for keeping/making their
software open source; part of valkyrie is based on their efforts. And thanks
to the Demul developers for the information they contributed.

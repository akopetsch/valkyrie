BEFORE UPLOADING THE TREE
-------------------------

Rewrite the JSON file to be more flexible (just like MAME.)

Move the JSON location to '$HOME/.local/share/valkyrie' or something.

I'll add more here later.

BOOTROM
-------

All three bootroms are pretty similar.

Fix texture coordinates for rendering. There's something creepingly odd
about them.

Fix texture commands.

The BOOTROM is a good testcase to implement the GPU IDMA.

Fix rendering to handle the CRT screen (basically store triangles and let
the EE8 [texcoord] command apply to the latest pushed triangle.)

AIRTRIX
-------

Fix GPU IRQs so that sync () returns 0 and the game moves out of the loop at
0C010EDE.

BRAVEFF
-------

Fix ROM layout for small EPROMS/MASKROMS, then check with the ROMBD test.

Implement SH-4 DMAC IRQ.

PHARRIER
--------

The ROMBD test says that the EPROMs are okay. It queries the TMU and
AICA clock. Crashes because of bad MASKROM mapping?

PODRACE
-------

Missing MASKROMS. Won't work.

SGNASCAR
--------

The game just doesn't boot. EPROM/MASKROM layout is wrong, and/or ROMBD
parameters read from the EPROM (in authenticate_rom () or late __init ())
simply don't work. To find out what is wrong, just look at the PR of
set_errno_and_init_machine ().

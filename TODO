BEFORE UPLOADING THE TREE
-------------------------

Move to CMake.

Rewrite the JSON file to be more flexible (just like MAME.)

Move the JSON location to '$HOME/.local/share/valkyrie' or something.

I'll add more here later.

BOOTROM
-------

Fix texture coordinates for rendering. There's something creepingly odd
about them.

Implement texture commands (2C1 and the like.)

The BOOTROM is a good testcase to implement the GPU IDMA.

Fix rendering to handle the CRT screen (basically store triangles and let
the EE8 [texcoord] command apply to the latest pushed triangle.)

Implement EEPROM handling (for all of them: MAINBD, MIE, ROMBD.)

Implement BRAM backup.

AIRTRIX
-------

Implement AICA in its own class, so that the game doesn't fail at the
"NO OPTIONAL SOUND BOARD" screen.

Implement more of the IO BOARD, so that the game doesn't fail at the
"NO IO BOARD" screen.

Implement rudimentary bitmap layer rendering.

BRAVEFF
-------

Fix ROM layout for small EPROMS/MASKROMS, then check with the ROMBD test.

Implement SH-4 DMAC IRQ.

Cyber Troops Virtual On 4
-------------------------

Not dumped yet.

PHARRIER
--------

The ROMBD test says that the EPROMs are okay. It queries the TMU and
AICA clock. Crashes because of bad MASKROM mapping?

PODRACE
-------

Missing MASKROMS. Won't work.

SGNASCAR
--------

The game just doesn't boot. EPROM/MASKROM layout is wrong, and/or ROMBD
parameters read from the EPROM (in authenticate_rom () or late __init ())
simply don't work. To find out what is wrong, just look at the PR of
set_errno_and_init_machine ().

The following patch makes the problematic check pass.

	case 0x0C00BC9A:
		/* Makes authenticate_rom pass also for SGNASCAR; the problem
		 * is that the EEPROM contents and the EPROM contents don't
		 * agree on something (EPROM size maybe?) */
		R(3) = 0;
		break;

However . The problem seems to be bad EPROM mapping and/or bad EEPROM values
influencing the boot process.

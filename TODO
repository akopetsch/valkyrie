TODO

BEFORE UPLOADING THE TREE
-------------------------

Move to CMake.

Rewrite the JSON file to be more flexible (just like MAME.)

Move the JSON location to '$HOME/.local/share/valkyrie' or something.

I'll add more here later.

BOOTROM
-------

Fix texture coordinates for rendering. There's something creepingly odd
about them.

Implement texture commands (2C1 and the like.)

The BOOTROM is a good testcase to implement the GPU IDMA.

Fix rendering to handle the CRT screen (basically store triangles and let
the EE8 [texcoord] command apply to the latest pushed triangle.)

Implement EEPROM handling (for all of them: MAINBD, MIE, ROMBD.)

Implement BRAM backup.

AIRTRIX
-------

Fix FTRV, FIPR against PR.

Fix bitmap layer rendering: the FB clearing routine and layer don't match.
Probably Y must be doubled.

BRAVEFF
-------

Missing MASKROMs. Won't work.

Cyber Troops Virtual On 4
-------------------------

Not dumped yet.

PHARRIER
--------

Implement DMAC and TMU.

Crashes because of unknown reasons.

PODRACE
-------

Missing MASKROMS. Won't work.

SGNASCAR
--------

The game just doesn't boot. EPROM/MASKROM layout is wrong, and/or ROMBD
parameters read from the EPROM (in authenticate_rom () or late __init ())
simply don't work. To find out what is wrong, just look at the PR of
set_errno_and_init_machine ().

The following patch makes the problematic check pass.

	case 0x0C00BC9A:
		/* Makes authenticate_rom pass also for SGNASCAR; the problem
		 * is that the EEPROM contents and the EPROM contents don't
		 * agree on something (EPROM size maybe?) */
		R(3) = 0;
		break;

However . The problem seems to be bad EPROM mapping and/or bad EEPROM values
influencing the boot process.

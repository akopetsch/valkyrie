BEFORE UPLOADING THE TREE
-------------------------

Fix the copyright in the [ch] files (year and license text.)`

Move the slave GPU access to hikaru-gpu.c. Proper support may require the
introduction of a new vk_device_accessors_t class.

Convert VK_*_{LOG,ERROR} from macros to functions; and add the DEVICE
variants.

Rewrite the JSON file to be more flexible (just like MAME.) Move its location
to '$HOME/.local/share/valkyrie' or something. Create that directory on
`make install'.

Convert TEXRAM and CMDRAM from vk_buffer_t's to simple byte arrays.

HIKARU
------

Save state support. This is mandatory.

Implement better AICA support (especially the RTC and IRQs.)

Implement better MIE support (that is, wrap a Z80 emulator in a
vk_cpu : z80 class and tape it in the code.)

Implement the three EEPROMs (MAINBD, ROMBD, MIE.)

SH4
---

Check FPU handling; especially FTRV, FIPR, PR, and XF/XD/FV/XMTRX access.

Implement simple per-basic-block LLVM translation. This should make debugging
a lot more bearable.

RENDERING
---------

Fix text rendering in the BOOTROM.

Figure out how to render the PHARRIER 3D intro screen. Aside from FPU
bugs, we should be ready to go! This requires (in order of importance):

- Fix Y coords in the BOOTROM menu. The translation component of the 161
  matrix doesn't seem to fix it; there must be some other offset somewhere
  in the command stream or MMIOs. Again, check against the BRAVEFF menu.

- Figure out how the projection matrix is specified.

- Figure out how the fade-in effect is done in the intro screen.

- Implement proper texture caching, for both textures (TEXRAM) and layers
  (FB). Right now 16% of all cycles are spent uploading the FB texture to
  OpenGL.

- Implement proper model caching using VBOs.

AIRTRIX
-------

Find out why it dies after the intro screen. Note that one MASKROM doesn't
pass the ROMBD test (all the other MASKROMs do.)

BRAVEFF
-------

Missing MASKROMs. Won't work. It works enough to display the test menu
though. Or at least it did some time ago.

Cyber Troops Virtual On 4
-------------------------

Not dumped yet.

PHARRIER
--------

Render the 3D intro screen using the youtube footage as a reference. Figure
out why the 161 commands contain garbage info.

Remove the out-of-bound-DMA-bug patch; it may be fucking up the intro
screen.

PODRACE
-------

Missing MASKROMS. Won't work. Useful to test MASKROM shrinkage tho (the
second problem SGNASCAR has.)

SGNASCAR
--------

For some reason the ROM->RAM transfer table at EPROM offset +390 tells
the BOOTROM to read 01FF0000 bytes from the ROM aperture at 03xxxxxx.
The problem is that the aperture is only 16MB wide, so the BOOTROM ends
up reading garbage from the 04xxxxxx MEMCTL device.

Adding a patch to make the memcpy loop respect the bounds make SGNASCAR
jump to the newly-copied code, but later writes stuff to the BOOTROM
read-only area.

Note that MASKROMs are not mapped correctly: contrarily to AIRTRIX and
PHARRIER the CRCs compute by the ROMBD test menu are wrong.

TODO
====

There are loads of TODO/XXX items in the source, grep them!


GENERAL
-------

Add support for "required" field in the JSON file.

For later, write an event-driven scheduler.

I'm seriously thinking about slowling "porting" valkyrie to C++... Mmm.


HIKARU
------

Move the slave GPU access to hikaru-gpu.c. Proper support may require the
introduction of a new vk_device_accessors_t class.

Proper MIE emulation (wrap a Z80 emulator in a vk_cpu_t sub-class and tape
it to the code.)

Proper AICA emulation (especially the RTC and IRQs.)

Implement the three EEPROMs (MAINBD, ROMBD, MIE.)


SH-4
----

Import the LLVM jit core into valkyrie. Still a bit rough on the edges, but
already faster than the interpreter.

Fix the TMU frequency, may help with flashing graphics in PHARRIER.


GPU / RENDERING
---------------

The projection clipping planes are probably scaled by some value, because
using the ones provided by the games as they are leads to a far too close
far clipping plane. Use 'p' to toggle a standard 90 degree FOV projection and
see things (affects all games).

Fix alpha ordering, urgently.

Fix instanced rendering; there is no linking system, just odd matrices.

Figure out where the spotlight angles are (194 is the best candidate).

Implement framebuffer blending (instructions 781, 181; PHARRIER).

Figure out the effect of mesh LOD on texturing (normally, and SGNASCAR),
disable mipmaps when appropriate (instruction 0C1 maybe).

Fix fogging.

Implement alpha testing (used in BRAVEFF, instruction 154).

Implement proper model caching using VBOs.

Fix texture wrap/repeat (BRAVEFF, AIRTRIX do not work properly yet.)


AIRTRIX
-------

Attract mode works.

Emulation wise, the biggest issue is with the player character: it is not
animated. Talking with the Demul guys, we figured out the following: the game
uploads matrix data to CMDRAM  48100000-48100E2x, along with commands, but we
don't know what device that data is for. It is written by the master SH-4 but
never reads them back, and there is strong evidence that the slave SH-4 does
not touch them ever. The matrices come along with a pointer to a GPU routine in
CMDRAM (in master-SH-4-address-space-format), which, guess what?, draws the
player character. I *think* they specify additional transformations to be
applied to the skater body parts, but I don't know yet how.


BRAVEFF
-------

Attract mode works.

PODRACE
-------

Not fully dumped yet.


SGNASCAR
--------

Attract mode works.

The BOOTROM (all version) reads from invalid memory regions when loading the
game data from ROM to RAM; that is likely a game bug.

Make sure you have development packages for SDL and libjansson installed.
Under Debian (and likely Ubuntu) it's as simple as:

 $ sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libjansson-dev

Then just do:

 $ cd path/to/valkyrie
 $ make

This will generate the bin/valkyrie binary. To run valkyrie, type:

 $ bin/valkyrie -R $PATH_TO_ROM_DIRECTORY -r $ROM_NAME

Example:

 $ bin/valkyrie -R ~/roms/hikaru -r bootrom

You can also install valkyrie for your user with:

 $ make install

This will compile and install a copy of the valkyrie binary in ~/.local/bin
and a copy of vk-games.json (the game description list used by valkyrie) in
~/.local/share/valkyrie. After this step, you can just do:

 $ valkyrie -R $PATH_TO_ROM_DIRECtory -r $ROM_NAME

from anywhere in your filesystem.

XXX: due to the (dumb) way the loading code is designed, the ROM_DIRECTORY
is expected to contain a sub-directory for each game, containing the
uncompressed ROM images _and_ a copy of (or a symlink to) the BOOTROM image.
The latter should be named `hikaru_0.X.bin', where X is the bootrom version,
that is, one of 84, 92 or 96. I *know* it is very rough, patches are welcome.
